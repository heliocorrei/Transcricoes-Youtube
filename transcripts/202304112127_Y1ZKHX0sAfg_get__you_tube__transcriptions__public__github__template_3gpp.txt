so today
I'm gonna show you this my new project
get YouTube transcriptions and the idea
here is to allow in a public GitHub
template
uh we get YouTube transcription
uh in the
readme.nd file uh we have all the
instructions you need uh to go from
create your repo to extract or to get
your first YouTube transcription it's
actually really simple uh the idea here
uh is that you you not need to make and
and
local setup we will use GitHub actions
power so let's get started and use this
template as Sean and explain as
explained here in our
readme.md file first of all you have to
use these template and create one for
you
okay uh here you have this option to
select your your
organizations as you see uh I have more
than one but I will choose uh my my
personal organization uh I will do I
let's
let's make uh get YouTube
YouTube
transcription
[Music]
tests because the other name already
exists uh I'm leave this new repo as
public and let's create
okay
just a few minutes as I said I will not
have to clone or to use our local
environment to uh get to YouTube
transcriptions uh the only configuration
the only thing we need here is to allow
GitHub actions to perform
uh and this could be done here
actions General
make sure that this option is marked and
this one to read and write permission
that's it really simple and let's get
started
with our first YouTube transcription
let's take
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to make it okay
uh the video the YouTube video ID is
here we can copy and past
as a new issue title
is like that
when you do that you can see
in the actions tab uh all the process
been doing uh for GitHub in GitHub
uh so we have to wait just I think less
than a minute it's pretty fast actually
GitHub it's uh during a new machine for
us it's all all dependencies and
then
it will get our
uh transcription using
our script
then the new file uh will be committed
and you see this
in the transcripts
uh folder so let's see how to make a
website with a python and with we can
see here how to make a website with
python because this is the the pattern
we use to create when we create our txt
file uh the video ID and then the the
video title if we click here we can see
that we have in English how generated a
transcript
and let's see if we have another run now
just Just One auto generated uh if more
than one transcript is available we will
get all the possibilities and we will
put all here in this new txt file that's
it I hope you'll find this new template
useful and if you find something or if
you want to suggest something let's
create here a new issue for us not in
this repo but in my original one
that's it guys
bye
