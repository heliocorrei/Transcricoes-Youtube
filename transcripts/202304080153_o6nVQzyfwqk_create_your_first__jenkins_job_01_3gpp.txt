create your Jenkins first job so once
you log into the Jenkins click on new
item
and name your job name
job is nothing but uh
nothing but it has so
let me do my first job
and do freestyle freestyle the simple
simple job
click on that
and if you want to give it a description
then this is the first job so I don't
know I don't want to make it complicated
initially it looks overwhelming but once
you get used to it so it's going to be
easier
so scroll down just click on build steps
and execute shell
so
if I do Echo
hello world
and Save
so if you run this shop so it's gonna
this task this command is going to run
on your host machine so I'm hosting this
Jenkins server on this Ubuntu so if you
run that so it's gonna run over here so
let's check that
save
then the bill now is nothing but
executing your job
so the whenever you pick on this build
now so it's gonna exit your job then
it's gonna run
whatever you're gonna put inside this
job so when you see the blue green thick
that means it's successful even you can
check that jobs output over here as well
so it's it's a success so because that
job has gone
successfully so
uh so in order to prove that this job is
running on that post machine so if I do
any command
if the if that
machine doesn't have that command so if
I
if I look for terraform
iPhone version
adjust terraform let's see
so if I build it again
it's gonna fail now because that host
machine doesn't have that terraform
install in itself
so it says failure
oh I'm sorry this host motion seems has
data form
let me let me check that just uh jump
back to your terminal let's do
that from
okay let's do something uh some invalid
command
so it says command not form so let's try
the same thing
through the Jenkins UI so let's
let's go back to a job click on over
here then click on configure to edit
your job
then uh instead just type LS something
any invalid commands then save
if you click on Bill now again
a job executed if you click on here and
the console output
then you can see that uh
lsdk not formed
so this is a simple job later we're
gonna do some complicated jobs
